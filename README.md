## About
Compass is a simple and easy to use system for game input navigation. Simply put, it can be a lot of trouble going between checking if an object is 
hovered with a mouse or if it is selected with a keyboard input or gamepad input. This sytem helps allieviate that by utilizing object targets to determine
where input cursors are.

## Getting Started
To start you can simply use the various `compass_*` functions and the system will automatically begin running! You can set up some defaults in the 
`CompassConfig()` script to automatically handle things or set them up in some create event. The main function to utilize is `compass_object_set`.
This function sets *Compass* to know what objects it should search and select, for both mouse input as well as 'directional' inputs. 

## Examples
You can find 3 examples in the project files above showcasing various modes and ways to use *Compass*
